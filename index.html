    You are now ready to build the AngularJS phonecat app. In this step, you will become familiar with the most important source code files, learn how to start the development servers bundled with angular-seed, and run the application in the browser.

    In angular-phonecat directory, run this command:

    git checkout -f step-0
    This resets your workspace to step 0 of the tutorial app.

    You must repeat this for every future step in the tutorial and change the number to the number of the step you are on. This will cause any changes you made within your working directory to be lost.

    If you haven't already done so you need to install the dependencies by running:

    npm install
    To see the app running in a browser, open a separate terminal/command line tab or window, then run npm start to start the web server. Now, open a browser window for the app and navigate to http://localhost:8000/app/index.html
